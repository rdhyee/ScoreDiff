# ScoreDiff #

The goal of this project is to create a simple python tool that can be used to compare two music scores.  

The code will rely on the music21 toolkit, which you can read about and download here: [music21](http://mit.edu/music21/ "music21")

The preliminaries directory above contains some simple test code that I'm using to explore music21.
Bits of pieces of it will likely show up in the finished product.
