This directory contains some sample mus and mxl files that I may use
for testing at some point.  The Mozart piece is something I generated
based on the correspondin mxl file in the music21 corpus, and Scriabin
pieces were generated by using music21 to parse the mxl files found
at: [scriabin](http://kern.ccarh.org/cgi-bin/ksdata?location=users/craig/classical/scriabin/op8&file=etude8-05.krn&format=info "scriabin")

The resulting Scriabin .mus files are particularly hideous, so they present
a good opportunity to see how much the finished tool can really pick up on.
