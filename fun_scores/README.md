This directory contains some sample mus and mxl files that I may use
for testing at some point.  The Mozart piece is something I generated
based on the corresponding mxl file in the music21 corpus, and Scriabin
pieces were generated by using music21 to parse the xml files found
at: [scriabin](http://kern.ccarh.org/cgi-bin/ksbrowse?type=collection&l=/users/craig/classical/scriabin "scriabin")

The resulting Scriabin .mus files are particularly hideous, so they present
a good opportunity to see how much the finished tool can really pick up on.

There are several options when reading .mus files, but finale is probably the
easiest choice.  You can download finale here: [finale](http://www.finalemusic.com/notepad/default.aspx "finale")

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the website above has a linux version, but
I'm sure linux users can find a creative solution.
